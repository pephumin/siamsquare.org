<h2>Getting started guide</h2>

<p>This document is divided into two main sections. The first section is for general users. It explains how to use this tool to create a survey, test it, and incorporate it into a web page. The second section is for administrators. It explains how to manage a group of related users, and to use the access control system.</p>

<h2>User guide</h2>

<p>There are three basic things that users do: make surveys, deploy surveys, and retrieve or export the data.</p>

<h4>Making surveys</h4>

<p>This is a straight forward procedure. Begin with</p>

<ul class="pe-ul">
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Create a New Survey and follow the forms and prompts through the procedure. When you have made a survey you can use</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Change the Status of a Survey to put the survey in 'Test' mode, or go right on to deploying it</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deploying surveys</h4>

<p>After a survey is made (and tested), you can deploy it. This is as simple as going to</p>

<p>Change the Status of a Survey and clicking on 'Activate'. There are two options for the deployment of a survey: one is to embed it in a customized HTML page, or to use the automatic template (which is very plain and simple). To use the automatic template, simply use the URL that was given to you on the 'Finish' tab. If you want to have the survey embedded on some custom web page insert the PHP tag that was given on the 'Finish' tab in the desired place in your HTML file. Please make sure the HTML file you put that code in has a '.php' extension!</p>

<h4>Retrieving data</h4>

<p>For any survey that is in Testing, Active or Ended you can go to</p>

<p>Export Data to CSV and download a copy of the data from your survey. The 'download' option will allow you to save the data on the computer your web browser is running on, otherwise the data is saved to a file on the web server (typically in the /tmp directory). It is recommended that you use the 'download' option.</p>

<h4>Other actions</h4>

<ul class="pe-ul">
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>User can also make copies of surveys, which is very handy if you want to change a survey that has already left the Edit/Test phase. Copying copies the survey questions, none of the collected data is copied. A copy of a survey is placed in 'Editing' mode.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>User can test a survey, which just lets you collect data and make sure it works as desired.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>User can view tabulated results in a 'pretty' format.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>User can also view a survey report, which may be useful to help interpreting the data collected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Administrator guide</h2>

<p>Before beginning administration you must understand the user/group relationship. There are three classes of users.

<ul class="pe-ul">
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>'Superusers' (that is you, the Administrator) have complete control in the Administration Mode.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>'Designers' are the users who will be creating, deploying, and analyzing surveys.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>The third class is the 'Respondents', these accounts are for private surveys (surveys which require a user to login before entering data).</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the Designers and the Respondents is associated with a group. It is expected that a group will contain members of a similar area. For example there may be a group for a department, or a club, or just for some arbitrary group of people who are working on a similar subject. There may exists an unlimited number of groups.</p>

<p>There are two main levels of administration.</p>

<ul class="pe-ul">
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>'Superuser' which is the highest level. It lets you control all users, and all surveys.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>'Group Manager' is the second level of administration. It has similar control to the superuser, but limited to the subset of users (and their surveys) in their group.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Superusers</h4>

<p>The 'superuser' are users who are a member of the special group 'superuser'. <strong>As a superuser, your responsibility should only be to create new groups and create group managers.</strong></p>

<p>Once a group manager has been created for a group, that user should be able to control all aspects of that group. However any action that is described below in the group manager section can be performed by a superuser, but a superuser is not restricted to actions in a group.</p>

<p>The superuser(s) will see the following administration options on the main menu:</p>

<ul class="pe-ul">
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Manage Designer Accounts</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Manage Respondent Accounts</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Manage Groups</li>
</ul>

<p>Manage Groups is very simple. This option simply lists the existing groups and has a form to add a new group. Group names should be short, and should not have spaces. Good examples of group names are: ITS, ProjectX, WebTeam, etc. The description of the group is free form; you may enter any text you wish but please make it understandable.</p>

<p>Manage Designer Accounts lets you add and remove users from groups, and change their permissions in each group. The page for this option lists all the existing user accounts. You can sort by Name or Group by clicking on the column heading. By clicking on a username, you can edit that entry.</p>

<p>Superusers should read the next section as well to learn the permission levels.</p>

<h4>Group managers</h4>

<p>Group managers have full control over a group. This means that they have permission to perform all user functions, such as editing, testing, releasing and archiving. A group manager also can add and remove users from their groups.</p>

<p>There are four basic user permission options, and two administration permission options. The user options are:</p>

<ul class="pe-ul">
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Design Surveys: Allow the user to create, edit and test surveys. This option is on by default, and is probably desired for most situations.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Change Survey Status: This lets a user change the status of a survey. Essentially this gives them the ability to release, end, and archive surveys.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Export Survey Data: Users with this flag, have the option to download the data collected from a survey.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Group Editor: By default, users can only perform any of the three actions above on their own surveys. If the Group Editor flag is on, the above permissions are widened to include all surveys created by members of the group.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two options set administration flags:</p>

<ul class="pe-ul">
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Administer Designers: This grants the user permission to change flags on users in their group, and to add new users to the group.</li>
<li><i class="pe-li pe-check-square"></i>Administer Respondents: Allows a user to add users to the list of allowed respondents, within their group.</li>
</ul>
